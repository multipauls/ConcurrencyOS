# Question 1: Concurrent Merge Sort:
## Functions:
	- selSort: Selection sort for when the number of elements<5
	- shareMem(from tutorial code): share memory between processes
	- merge: merge 2 sorted arrays
	- conMergeSort: concurrent merge sort
	- mergeSort: normal merge sort
	- runSorts(format from tutorial code): run both and compare the times and print
	- main function

## Logic:
	- Standard merge sort for the normal case
	- In the case of the processes, the parent fork sleft child, then forks right child, waits for both children to finish and exit and merges

## Comparisons:
	- With the selSort condition, anywhere between 40-150x faster
	- Without the selSort condition, anywhere between 100-300x faster
